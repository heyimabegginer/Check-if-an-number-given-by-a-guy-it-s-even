# this will tell you if a number is even or odd , pretty basic stuff(Python)
try:
n = int(input("Enter a natural number: "))
remainder.number.when.divided.by.2 = n % 2

if remainder.number.when.divided.by.2 == 0:
      print("The number you chose is even")
else:
      print("The number you chose is odd")


except ValueError:
print("You didn't choose a natural number")


#this code is pretty simple , you are using "try" and "except" statements so if the user gets the error when he doesnt enter a natural number it will even tell him what his mistake was


#Why is not this working?
